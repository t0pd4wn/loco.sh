# .loco_startup | Provide terminal startup steps (first, everytime)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Below scripts provide functions to trigger commands, when terminal is open.
# The inital check is made upon VPN connection status. 

# To set this up properly
# 1. start your vpn connection.
# 2. launch `ip addr show` in the terminal.
# 3. check for your vpn connection name (usually last in the list ("tun0" for OpenVPN)).
# 4. in the `is_started` function below change "VPN_identifier" for this name.
# 5. optional : if you are using the "vpn(startup)" loco.sh profile, 
# in `wireguard_connect` or `openvpn_connect` change your vpn configurations paths.
# 6. last, you need to set your terminal as a startup application.
# For Ubuntu users : 
# - open the 'Startup applications preferences' from the applications.
# For MacOS users : 
# - open then Apple menu, then 'System Settings', then 'General' then 'Login Items'.
# From now on, accessing your system will open the terminal and connect you to your VPN.

# Called from .bashrc ; checks if VPN is connected
# note : change "VPN_identifier" for your VPN identifier 
# (something that distinguishes it in `ip addr show`)
